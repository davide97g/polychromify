# Vision & Cognitive Services Project Proposal

## Image Colorization

Colorization is the process of adding plausible color information to monochrome photographs or videos.
It is a highly undetermined problem, requiring mapping a real-valued luminance image to a three-dimensional color-valued one, that has not a unique solution.

## Dataset

Many papers addressing the image colorization challenge used a dataset generated with images taken from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/).
For my project, I will download this dataset of 25k images from _Flickr_ as used by _???_ in "???".

## Method

I will build my custom deep learning model starting from the one reported in _Colorful Image Colorization_ by _Zhang et al_.
Moreover I will compare my algorithm to previous implementation like:

- _Colorful Image Colorization_ by _???_
- _???_ by _???_
- _???_ by _???_
